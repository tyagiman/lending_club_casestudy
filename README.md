The case study is about lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants,which is the largest source of credit loss to financial companies. Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of driver variables which can help in identifying such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
